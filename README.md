#Experimental Operating System

This is a lab work done during the B Tech S5 course. A very intuitive and practical approach to teach the students about the basic concepts of an Operating system, how it is built, how processes, files and memory is managed. 

##Different stages

There are 11 stages in this Lab work. The roadmap is available [here](http://xosnitc.github.io/roadmap). Within these 11 stages, we learnt File Management, Process Management and Memory Management.
